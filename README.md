# 🏋️‍♂️ IskoCoach — Real-Time Squat Pose Coach

IskoCoach is a real-time computer vision fitness assistant built using **MediaPipe Pose** and **Streamlit**.  
It counts **squat repetitions**, evaluates **form quality**, gives **live feedback**, and maintains each user’s workout history with data visualizations.

🎯 **Goal:** Help beginners learn proper squat form with AI-powered guidance — no wearable sensors needed!

## 🧠 Computer Vision Model

- **Model Used:** MediaPipe BlazePose (pretrained)
- **What It Tracks:** 2D skeletal keypoints (33 body landmarks)
- **How It Works (Simplified):**
  1. Extract hip → knee → ankle joint coordinates
  2. Compute **knee angle** per frame
  3. Detect **Up → Down → Up** transitions using threshold rules
  4. Track spine alignment using vector geometry (dot-product)

### 🔍 Limitations
- Works best with clear full-body visibility
- Requires upright front/side camera angle for accurate angles
- Heuristic-based form evaluation → can improve with ML classifier in future

## 🧪 Evaluation

We evaluated our rep counter and scoring system using:
- **Ground-truth manual rep annotations**
- Per-frame logs from webcam sessions

Metrics included:
- **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)
- **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)
- **% accuracy within ±1 rep**
- **Correlation between form score and rep error**

📊 Charts generated:
- Error histogram  
- Score vs Absolute Error  
- Reps over time per user  
- User comparison plots  

🎯 Summary: The system performs accurately under controlled conditions, with only minor miscounts when the user is partially occluded or camera height varies.

👉 Evaluation scripts are in the `evaluation/` folder.
